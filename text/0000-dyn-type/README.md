# Summary

Generalize the concept of Dynamic Sized Types (DSTs) and enable custom DSTs.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

This RFC is a replacement of [RFC #1524]. The main motivations of custom DSTs are:

* DST allows us to get rid of combinatorial explosion when interacting with smart pointers. Instead
    of defining `BoxMatrix`, `RcMatrix`, `GcMatrix` etc, we get `Box<Matrix>`, `Rc<Matrix>`,
    `Gc<Matrix>` from a single type.

* The `Index` and `Deref` trait requires us to return a reference without allocation, i.e. indexing
    operation canâ€™t return a `MatrixRef<'a>` even if this is the only solution without custom DST.

* Allow more possibilities for modifying existing APIs involving DST types without breakage.

We expect many types will benefit from custom DSTs, here are some examples:

* Multi-dimensional arrays (matrix and tensor libraries).
* Length-prefixed structures e.g. Pascal strings or C structures with a flexible array member.
* `CStr`.
* `OsStr` on Windows (WTF-8 slice or multi-encoded string).
* Bit array.
